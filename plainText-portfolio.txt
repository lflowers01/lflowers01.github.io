About Me
Over the past four years, I have explored engineering through hands-on, interdisciplinary
experiences at the intersection of software, hardware, and systems design. My work has
been shaped most strongly by robotics, where I served as the lead programmer across
multiple FIRST Robotics Competition teams and ultimately founded my own team, Team
Epsilon. Through these experiences, I learned how technical decisions, team structure, and
real-world constraints combine to shape successful engineering outcomes.
Beyond robotics, I have pursued opportunities that emphasized both technical depth and
human impact. I studied kinematics, haptics, and assistive robotics through a pre-college
program at Wentworth Institute of Technology, contributed to an assistive technology
project as a state finalist in Makers of Change, and gained hands-on fabrication experience
through my internship at Phoenix Forge. These projects pushed me to move beyond
individual components and think in terms of complete systems, integrating software,
electronics, mechanics, and user needs.
This portfolio highlights selected projects that reflect how I approach engineering: learning
by building, iterating through failure, and designing systems that are both technically
rigorous and purposeful. Together, these experiences have shaped my interest in systems
engineering and autonomous systems, where thoughtful integration and responsibility-
driven design are central to meaningful innovation.

FRC Team Epsilon
May 2025 - Present
Founder, President & Lead Programmer
Project Overview
Team Epsilon is a student-founded, student-led FIRST Robotics Competition team based in
North Phoenix, Arizona. I co-founded the team in 2025 to create a small, hands-on, and
technically rigorous engineering environment that more closely mirrors real-world
engineering teams.
After multiple seasons on school-based robotics teams, my co-founder and I identified
limitations in design freedom, purchasing timelines, and student leadership opportunities
imposed by district systems. We decided to take full responsibility for building a team from
the ground up. Starting out of a friend’s garage, we recruited members across multiple
schools, developed a business plan, and formally registered Team Epsilon as a nonprofit
organization.
From the beginning, we structured the team to operate like a startup: students own projects
end-to-end, collaborate across disciplines, and are accountable for both technical and
organizational decisions. This approach allows members to gain experience not only in
robotics engineering, but also in systems integration, project management, fundraising, and
leadership.
As a rookie team, we have already built a full practice robot
during the off-season, grown to over 12 active members,
and raised more than $20,000 in funding. As we enter
our first competitive season, Team Epsilon reflects my
belief that engineering education is most effective when
students are trusted with responsibility, encouraged to
take risks, and supported through mentorship.
Problem & Design Challenge
Our primary challenge was designing an engineering environment that provided
meaningful responsibility and technical depth for students across Arizona. In many
traditional high school engineering classes and large, school-based FRC teams, students
often specialize narrowly or have limited ownership over complete systems due to team
size, scheduling constraints, and administrative limitations.

We believe students learn engineering most effectively when they are trusted with real
responsibility, held to clear expectations, and exposed to the realities of collaborative,
deadline-driven work. To address this, we intentionally designed Team Epsilon to operate
like a small engineering startup. Team members are expected to take ownership of projects,
collaborate across disciplines, and follow through on commitments that directly affect team
performance.
The design challenge was not only technical, building a competitive robot, but
organizational: creating a structure that balances rigor with mentorship, accountability with
support, and ambition with sustainability. This approach allows students to experience
problem-solving, iteration, and responsibility that define real-world engineering while
maintaining a learning-focused environment.
My Role & Responsibilities
As founder, president, and lead programmer of Team Epsilon, I have taken primary
responsibility for both the technical and organizational development of the team. I created
the team’s business plan, programmed and maintained the team website, and developed its
branding and merchandise. I led grant writing and fundraising efforts to secure startup
funding and assisted in developing and managing the team budget.
I manage team operations by maintaining meeting agendas, communicating announcements
and schedules, and coordinating regular team meetings to ensure alignment across sub
teams. In addition, I oversee project planning and delegation, ensuring each member has
clearly defined responsibilities and that technical work progresses on schedule. This role
requires balancing engineering leadership with communication and financial planning,
closely mirroring the responsibilities of leading a small engineering organization.
So far, my most significant technical contribution has been
developing the vision-based auto-alignment system for our
off-season robot. The system uses two cameras running on
a dedicated coprocessor to dynamically detect fiducial
markers and estimate the robot’s pose in real time. When
the operator activates the system, the robot automatically
aligns itself based on these pose calculations, improving
accuracy and consistency during operation.
Implementing this system required careful calibration,
tuning, and integration with the robot’s control software.
To work efficiently despite limited physical access to the
robot (particularly while the mechanical team was still
assembling the chassis) I leveraged a simulation
environment to develop and test the vision pipeline and
control logic. This approach allowed me to iterate on the
system early and significantly reduce integration issues
once on-robot testing began.

Results & Impact
During the off-season, our team built a fully functional
practice robot to allow new members to develop technical
skills before the official competition season began. Beginning
in the summer, we designed and competed with this robot in
the Arizona Robotics League (ARL), a series of off-season
competitions hosted by local high schools across Arizona. The
league includes monthly events followed by a championship
tournament in October that uses a draft-based alliance
selection system.
Team Epsilon competed in three ARL events and was drafted
to compete in the championship tournament—the only rookie
team to be selected. At the championship event, we received
the Breakthrough Award, recognizing Team Epsilon as the
top emerging rookie team in Arizona.
Reflection & Next Steps
As the competition season approaches, I am excited to lead Team Epsilon through a full
engineering design cycle under competitive constraints. This year, we are registered to
compete at the North Arizona Regional and the Utah Regional, where our focus will be on
applying what we learned during the off-season to achieve higher performance and
reliability.
Seeing the idea of creating an independent, student-led team grow into a functioning and
competitive organization has been especially meaningful. Looking ahead, I plan to develop a
sustainability and leadership transition plan to ensure that Team Epsilon continues to grow
and operate successfully after I graduate.

Makers of Change — Assistive Technology Design (State
Finalist)
The Bluey Jamboard
State Finalist (Top 9 of 95+ Teams)
Hosted by Southwest Human Development
October 2025
Role: Embedded Systems Specialist
Project Overview
Makers of Change is a statewide assistive technology design challenge focused on creating
custom solutions for individuals with disabilities. Our team designed and built an
interactive game board for Levi, a child with cerebral palsy and related motor and
processing challenges. The goal was to create an engaging, accessible device that
encouraged interaction, fine motor practice, and inclusive play for Levi and his siblings.
Our project was selected as a state finalist (Top 9 out of 95+ teams across Arizona),
recognizing both its technical execution and its impact-driven design.
Problem & Design Challenge
Levi experiences cerebral palsy, hypertonia in his legs, hypotonia in his torso, and
challenges with fine motor control and language processing. Many off-the-shelf games are
not accessible to children with these needs, either requiring precise motor control or failing
to sustain engagement.
6
The design challenge was to create a device that balanced accessibility, durability, and
engagement within a limited time and budget. The solution needed to be easy to use,
visually appealing, and adaptable to Levi’s physical abilities, while also being safe and
enjoyable for shared play with siblings.
My Role & Responsibilities
As the lead programmer and a primary technical contributor, I was responsible for both
software development and key hardware integration, including:
• Programming interactive games on the Raspberry Pi with accessibility and
engagement as core design goals
• Wiring physical button inputs using the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins
• Managing power distribution and system startup for the Raspberry Pi
• Integrating and configuring the display, including troubleshooting screen
compatibility and resolution issues
• Collaborating with teammates to ensure alignment between the physical enclosure
and system behavior
Process
Our team began by researching Levi’s diagnoses and understanding how his physical and
cognitive needs affected everyday interactions. We brainstormed multiple concepts and
used CAD tools to design the physical layout of the device.
Due to time constraints, we pivoted from building a full table to creating a tabletop
interactive game board. I initially programmed a balloon-popping game, but after testing,
we realized it lacked sustained engagement. I then reprogrammed the system to run a
multi-player basketball game with large, easy-to-press buttons to better support motor
accessibility and cooperative play.
In addition to software development, I handled much of the system integration, including
wiring the buttons, managing power to the Raspberry Pi, and configuring the display.
Setting up the screen required troubleshooting hardware compatibility and display settings
to ensure reliable operation within the custom enclosure. This close integration between
hardware and software allowed the device to function as a cohesive, user-friendly system.
Results
The final device successfully met its design goals by providing an accessible, engaging game
that Levi could use independently or with his siblings. The system’s large buttons, clear
visual feedback, and simple game mechanics supported usability while maintaining
enjoyment.
Our project was recognized at the state level as a Top 9 finalist out of more than 95
teams, validating both the engineering approach and the project’s social impact.

Reflection
This project reinforced the importance of designing technology around real users rather
than abstract requirements. Small engineering decisions—such as button placement,
display configuration, and game pacing—had a significant impact on accessibility and
engagement.
If given more time for this project, I would add configurable difficulty levels and additional
game modes to better adapt the device to different users and abilities. This experience
strengthened my interest in human-centered engineering and showed me how thoughtful
integration of hardware and software can directly improve quality of life.

Minecraft Server Wizard — CS50 Final Project
Final project for CS50
December 2023
Demo video
Project Overview
Minecraft Server Wizard is a command-line tool designed to simplify the installation and
management of Minecraft servers on Windows. Developed as my CS50 Final Project, the
tool abstracts the complexity of manual server setup into a guided, interactive workflow. By
automating tasks such as server installation, Java configuration, plugin management, and
backups, the project makes server hosting accessible to users without advanced technical
knowledge.
Problem & Design Challenge
Setting up a Minecraft server typically requires manual installation of Java, downloading
server JAR files, editing configuration files, managing plugins, and maintaining backups.
These steps are error-prone and intimidating for many users, especially those without
experience working in command-line environments.
The design challenge was to reduce this complexity while maintaining flexibility and
control. The tool needed to handle system dependencies, user input, and external APIs
reliably, all while providing clear feedback and preventing common configuration errors.
Additionally, the project had to be packaged as a standalone executable for ease of use.
My Role & Responsibilities
I independently designed and implemented the entire project, including:
• Designing the command-line interface and user interaction flow
• Automating server installation, Java detection, and memory allocation
• Integrating external APIs to fetch and install the latest server JAR files
• Implementing plugin installation, updating, enabling/disabling, and version tracking
• Creating automated backup functionality with timestamped file management
• Packaging the application into a standalone Windows executable using PyInstaller
• Writing documentation and producing a video demonstration for CS50
Process & Development
I began by mapping the manual steps required to set up a Minecraft server and identifying
opportunities for automation. Using Python, I built a modular command-based system that
guides users through installation and server configuration.
9
The tool dynamically retrieves server builds from external APIs and installs Java when
necessary. Plugin management is handled through web scraping and version comparison,
allowing the tool to detect and update outdated plugins automatically. To improve usability,
I added built-in help commands and clear error messages.
Once the core functionality was complete, I packaged the application into a single
executable using PyInstaller, allowing users to run the program without installing Python or
dependencies. I tested the tool across multiple configurations and documented common
troubleshooting scenarios.
Results & Impact
The final tool successfully automates the full lifecycle of a Minecraft server, from installation
to ongoing management. Users can install servers, manage plugins, create backups, and
start or stop servers using simple commands.
The project demonstrates how complex system administration tasks can be abstracted into
an accessible interface without sacrificing functionality. It also reflects my ability to design
software that prioritizes user experience while managing real-world constraints such as
system compatibility and dependency management.
Reflection & Next Steps
This project strengthened my understanding of software abstraction, automation, and user-
centered design. I learned how to design tools that anticipate user errors and simplify
complex workflows without hiding important functionality.
If extended, I would add cross-platform support for Linux, improve error handling for edge
cases, and implement a graphical interface for users less comfortable with command-line
tools. This project confirmed my interest in building tools that make complex systems more
accessible and reliable.

Physics Projectile Motion Simulator
https://github.com/lflowers01/projectile-sim
https://www.lucasflowers.net/projectile-sim
May 2025
Project Overview
This project is a web-based interactive projectile motion simulator developed as a final
project for my Physics course. The goal was to translate the kinematic equations of
projectile motion into a real-time, visual simulation that allows users to explore how force,
launch angle, height, and mass affect a projectile’s trajectory.
Rather than producing static graphs or calculations, I designed the simulator to be fully
interactive, enabling users to manipulate parameters and observe the resulting motion,
velocity vectors, and displacement in real time.
Problem & Design Challenge
Projectile motion is often taught abstractly through equations, which can make it difficult
for students to build intuition about how variables interact. The challenge was to create a
simulation that was both physically accurate and intuitive, while remaining responsive and
visually clear.
From an engineering perspective, the simulation needed to remain stable regardless of
frame rate, support multiple simultaneous projectiles, and clearly communicate both
motion and underlying physics concepts without overwhelming the user.
My Role & Responsibilities
I independently designed and implemented the entire simulation, including:
• Modeling projectile motion using kinematic equations and real-time integration
• Designing object-oriented classes for projectiles, aiming mechanics, and vector
visualization
• Implementing gravity and time-based updates using frame-rate-independent
calculations
• Creating an interactive aiming system that converts user input into force and angle
vectors
• Visualizing velocity components and full trajectories for educational clarity
• Designing a UI with sliders and controls for mass, height, and force
Process & Development
I structured the simulation using a modular, object-oriented approach. Each projectile
tracks its own position, velocity, and trajectory history, while gravity is applied
11
incrementally using a normalized time step based on deltaTime. This ensures consistent
physics behavior even under varying performance conditions.
To improve conceptual understanding, I visualized both the horizontal and vertical velocity
components as vectors and rendered the projectile’s full trajectory path. An interactive
aiming system allows users to adjust launch angle and force by dragging a control point,
providing immediate visual feedback.
Throughout development, I iteratively tested parameter ranges and scaling factors to
balance realism, performance, and usability.
Results & Impact
The final simulator accurately models projectile motion and allows users to experiment
with different launch conditions in real time. Interactive design makes abstract physics
concepts more intuitive by directly linking mathematical parameters to visual outcomes.
This project helped reinforce my understanding of physics, numerical simulation, and user-
focused software design, and it demonstrated how engineering tools can be used to enhance
learning rather than simply calculate results.
Reflection & Next Steps
This project strengthened my ability to translate mathematical models into functional
software systems and highlighted the importance of thoughtful visualization when
communicating technical concepts.
If extended, I would add features such as air resistance, energy analysis, and data export for
quantitative comparison. I would also explore separating the physics engine from the
rendering layer to support more advanced simulations.

High-Altitude Weather Balloon Camera System (In
Progress)
Bioscience E-tech hiking club
October 2025 – Present
Project Overview
This project is an in-progress high-altitude weather balloon camera system developed for
my Engineering III–IV course and my school’s E-Tech Club. The goal is to capture high-
altitude imagery of Earth and near-space using a lightweight, reliable camera payload
carried by a weather balloon. Previous launches relied on consumer action cameras, which
frequently failed due to power loss, storage issues, or environmental conditions. To improve
reliability and control, I am designing a custom camera system built around a Raspberry Pi
and multiple lightweight cameras.
Rather than prioritizing continuous high-frame-rate video, the system is designed to
capture clear, incremental images over the duration of the flight, producing a timelapse or
low-FPS video that maximizes reliability and image quality under extreme conditions.
Problem & Design Challenge
The primary challenge is designing a camera system that can
operate reliably for 4–6 hours in a high-altitude environment
while remaining under a strict 4-pound payload limit. At
altitude, the system must tolerate cold temperatures, limited
power availability, and the inability to physically intervene
once launched.
Additional constraints include ensuring continuous recording
without file corruption, minimizing power consumption, and
preventing software or hardware failures that could result in
data loss. These requirements necessitate careful tradeoffs
between image quality, frame rate, system complexity, and
power usage.
My Role & Responsibilities
As the camera systems lead, I am responsible for:
• Designing the camera architecture for the balloon payload
• Selecting lightweight, high-resolution USB cameras for the final system
• Developing Python scripts to reliably record images and video on the Raspberry Pi
• Creating a Flask-based web interface for testing, configuration, and data retrieval
• Prototyping and validating camera functionality using a development setup

• Planning transitions from a test-only configuration to an autonomous, flight-ready
system
Process & Development
I selected the Raspberry Pi for its low weight balance, processing capability, and USB
connectivity. Initial prototyping uses a standard USB webcam to validate software
functionality before transitioning to dual high-resolution Arducam cameras in the final
payload.
For early testing, I implemented a Flask web server that allows control and monitoring of
the camera system from a device on the same network. This interface is used for debugging
and configuration; in the final system, the software will automatically begin recording on
power-up without user interaction.
Design decisions emphasize simplicity and reliability. Rather than recording high-frame-
rate video, I plan to limit frame rate and capture incremental images to reduce power draw,
storage usage, and the risk of software instability.
Results & Impact
The current prototype successfully records imagery using a Raspberry Pi and USB camera
and supports remote configuration through a web interface. While the system is still in
early testing and requires further optimization, it establishes a functional foundation for the
final flight hardware.
Reflection & Next Steps
This project emphasized the importance of planning, reliability, and systems-level thinking
when designing for environments where failure is not recoverable. Working under weight,
power, and environmental constraints has reinforced how early design decisions shape
system success.
Next steps include implementing frame-rate limits, conducting extended runtime tests,
transitioning to the final camera hardware, and preparing the system for autonomous
operation during flight. Balancing technical ambition with realistic timelines has been a key
learning outcome as the project progresses toward launch.

Smart Vision Saw Safety System (In Progress)
Project for AZSEF/ISEF
Project Overview
This project is an in-progress engineering research project developed for submission to
the Arizona Science & Engineering Fair (AZSEF) and the International Science and
Engineering Fair (ISEF). The goal is to design a low-cost, camera-based safety system that
can proactively detect hands near a saw blade and rapidly cut power before contact occurs.
Unlike existing solutions that are typically designed for a single tool type, this system is
intended to be adaptable across a variety of common workshop tools, including table saws,
miter saws, and chop saws. By combining computer vision with a user-configurable
interface, the project explores how a single safety device can be flexibly deployed in
different workshop environments using affordable, off-the-shelf hardware.
Problem & Design Challenge
The primary challenge was designing a fast, reliable, and configurable safety system
suitable for multiple types of saws. In safety-critical applications, even small delays can
result in serious injury, making system latency a strict constraint. The system must detect
both the blade and a hand entering a defined danger zone and trigger a power cutoff within
a very short time window.
A second challenge was usability. Workshop tools vary significantly in geometry and
orientation, making fixed, hard-coded detection zones impractical. The system needed to
allow users to define blade location and detection boundaries while still relying on
intelligent computer vision rather than manual thresholds. Additionally, the system must
balance safety and practicality: minimizing false negatives is essential for injury prevention,
while excessive false positives can disrupt workflow and reduce trust in the system.
Process & Development
The system is built around a camera and single-board computer mounted near the cutting
area. During setup, the user interacts with the touchscreen display to visually define the
blade region by drawing a bounding box. This configuration allows the system to adapt to
different saw geometries without mechanical modification.
Once configured, the vision pipeline continuously analyzes camera frames to detect the
blade and any hands approaching it. Using spatial relationships between detected objects,
the system determines when a hand enters the defined danger zone. If this threshold is
crossed, the system immediately triggers a relay to cut power to the saw.
15
To meet AZSEF and ISEF evaluation standards, I developed a structured testing process to
measure detection accuracy and end-to-end system latency using timestamped logs and
video analysis. These measurements guide iterative tuning of model parameters and system
thresholds.
Next Steps
The next phase of this project is focused on system assembly and experimental testing. I will
construct a safe mock table saw blade using a low-torque motor and visual blade
representation, allowing the full system to be evaluated without introducing cutting risk.
The camera-based detection system will be integrated with a YOLO-style hand detection
model running on an Orange Pi 5 Pro, with careful optimization to maintain real-time
performance on embedded hardware.
Once assembled, I will conduct iterative testing to measure detection accuracy, false
positive rates, and end-to-end system latency from hand detection to stop signal. These
results will guide refinements to model selection, danger-zone thresholds, and processing
pipelines. Through this process, I aim to further develop my understanding of safety-critical
engineering, where rigorous testing and responsible decision-making are essential.
