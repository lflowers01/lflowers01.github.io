<h2 id="-genesis-the-rise-of-nettspend-"><strong>Genesis: The Rise of Nettspend</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>In the year of 2007, a child named Gunner Shepardson was born in Richmond, Virginia. And it was written: &quot;He shall bring the beats unto the masses.&quot;  </li>
<li>The Spirit of the Drank hovered over him, and he grew in strength and rhyme.  </li>
<li>From the void of SoundCloud arose Nettspend, who spoketh unto the people through 808s and distorted synths.  </li>
<li>The people heard <em>“Drankdrankdrank”</em> and proclaimed: “This is fire!”  </li>
<li>And lo, in the year 2024, Nettspend delivered his most sacred work, the <strong>BAD ASS F*CKING KID</strong>, a text that would shape the lives of Spenders for generations.  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="-the-ten-commandments-of-the-spenders-"><strong>The Ten Commandments of the Spenders</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Thou shalt always turn up to the holy beats of Nettspend.  </li>
<li>Thou shalt honor the Drank, for it sustains the vibe.  </li>
<li>Thou shalt not skip a Nettspend track.  </li>
<li>Thou shalt share the gospel of <em>“Leader”</em> and <em>“Perc Soda”</em> with thy crew.  </li>
<li>Thou shalt load thy playlist with bangers, for it is pleasing to Nettspend.  </li>
<li>Thou shalt not covet another’s drip, but instead find thy own swag.  </li>
<li><strong>Thou shalt not consume pork, for it is haram in the eyes of Nettspend.</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>If thou dost touch pork, thou must cleanse thy hands and soul in the sacred Drank.</strong>  </li>
<li>Thou shalt not mumble unless thou art on a beat.  </li>
<li>Thou shalt remember the Mixtape Day and keep it lit.  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="-the-gospel-according-to-the-drank-"><strong>The Gospel According to the Drank</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Nettspend spoketh to his disciples, saying, “Blessed are the turned-up, for theirs is the kingdom of bass.”  </li>
<li>He gathered the faithful at Rolling Loud and performed miracles, including turning water into energy drinks and multiplying the aux cords so all could partake.  </li>
<li>And the people chanted: &quot;Play that one song! The one with the <em>Tommy</em> sample!&quot;  </li>
<li>Nettspend replied: “Fear not, for the drip shall flow, and your playlists shall be eternal.”  </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="-the-parable-of-rhonda-"><strong>The Parable of Rhonda</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>In the early days, there was a follower named Rhonda who doubted Nettspend.  </li>
<li>Years later, when Nettspend ascended to greatness, he spoketh but a single line: “I got racks now, Rhonda.”  </li>
<li>And thus, the faithful learned the importance of believing in the grind.  </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="-the-new-testament-bad-ass-f-cking-kid-"><strong>The New Testament: BAD ASS F*CKING KID</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>And it came to pass, in the final month of 2024, Nettspend revealed his most divine work, the <strong>BAD ASS F*CKING KID</strong>, a gospel of rhythm and resilience.  </li>
<li>The faithful rejoiced at the release, for <em>“Growing Up”</em> taught them the struggles and triumphs of their prophet.  </li>
<li>In <em>“F</em>CK SWAG”*, Nettspend boldly declared independence from trends, creating an anthem for self-expression.  </li>
<li><em>“Skipping Class”</em> became the anthem of freedom, a call to reject the mundane and embrace the vibes.  </li>
<li>The track <em>“Beach Leak”</em> overflowed with divine rhythm, baptizing the Spenders in the waves of sound.  </li>
<li>Nettspend declared: “Let my beats heal thy soul. Let <em>“F</em>CK CANCER”* be thy anthem in times of trial.”  </li>
<li>And the people said, “Amen.”  </li>

<ol>
<li>The faithful shall pray three times a day upon their <strong>purple Drank carpet</strong>, facing the direction of the Sluttruck Church.  </li>
<li>Each prayer session begins with the chant:  <ul>
<li>“Drip flows, beats grow, Nettspend shine, let the vibes show.”  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At sunrise, the prayer of <strong>Morning Drip</strong> gives thanks for the day’s vibes.  </li>
<li>At midday, the prayer of <strong>Bass Blessing</strong> seeks rhythm and energy to sustain the grind.  </li>
<li>At sundown, the prayer of <strong>Shine Eternal</strong> offers gratitude for bangers dropped and drip revealed.  </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-sluttruck-church">The Sluttruck Church</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the holy parking lot of the Sluttruck Church, the faithful gather to pray and feast on the sacred menu.  </li>
<li>Nettspend spoketh: “Bring your crew here weekly, for this is where the vibes align and the sauce overfloweth.”  </li>
<li>It is written that those who visit the Sluttruck Church and give thanks shall receive blessings of unlimited bangers and fresh fits.  </li>
<li>Thou must kneel before the Drank Alter, for it is a holy altar, and repeat the sacred chant:  <ul>

<h2 id="-the-parable-of-the-drank-bridge-"><strong>The Parable of the Drank Bridge</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>There was once a mighty bridge made of shimmering liquid, stretching over a vast chasm of silence.  </li>
<li>Nettspend declared, “Only the faithful who vibe correctly may cross the Drank Bridge.”  </li>
<li>Those whose hearts were pure with rhythm and devotion found the Drank Bridge solid beneath their feet.  </li>
<li>But those who were unfaithful or skipped tracks fell into the void, their playlists forever cursed with ads.  </li>
